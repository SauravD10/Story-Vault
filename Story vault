    <!-- STORY ONE -->
    <article>
        <span class="genre-tag">Genre: Steampunk / Historical Fiction</span>
        <h2>The Bronze Astrolabe</h2>
        <p><span class="dropcap">E</span>lias wiped the salt spray from his goggles as the salvage crane groaned. From the Aegean depths rose a calcified lump of bronze, no bigger than a shoebox. While the crew cheered for gold, Elias saw the gears—intricate, interlocking teeth that shouldn't exist for another thousand years. He touched the corroded surface and felt the heartbeat of an ancient sky. This wasn't a treasure; it was a map of the heavens, built by hands that understood the music of the spheres long before the world went dark.</p>
        <p>"It tracks the moon," he whispered to the captain. "It tracks the sun. It tracks the very soul of time." In that moment, Elias realized that progress isn't a straight line; it's a circle that sometimes breaks, waiting for us to find the pieces and weld them back together.</p>
        <div class="fact-box">
            <strong>The Curiosity:</strong> This is based on the <i>Antikythera Mechanism</i>, discovered in 1901. It is the world's oldest analog computer, dating back to 150-100 BC. It could predict eclipses and planetary motions with staggering accuracy, technology that was lost to history for nearly 1,500 years.

    <!-- STORY TWO -->
    <article>
        <span class="genre-tag">Genre: Cyberpunk / Philosophy</span>
        <h2>The 7-Year Ghost</h2>
        <p><span class="dropcap">K</span>ai sat in the neon glow of the 'New-U' clinic. He had just replaced his left humerus with a carbon-fiber weave. Over the last decade, he’d swapped the lungs, the liver, and even the memories of his first heartbreak for high-definition simulations. He looked at his hands. "Am I still Kai?" he asked the technician.</p>
        <p>The technician laughed, a sound like grinding glass. "Kid, look at the biologicals. They do the same thing. They just do it slower. You’re a river, not the water inside it. The water moves on, but the river remains." Kai realized then that identity isn't a collection of parts, but the pattern they leave behind as they vanish.</p>
        <div class="fact-box">
            <strong>The Life Fact:</strong> In biology, this is known as <i>Dynamic Equilibrium</i>. Most of the cells in your body are replaced every 7 to 10 years. You are, quite literally, not the same person you were a decade ago. Philosophically, this is the <i>Ship of Theseus</i> paradox.

        <h2>The Wood Wide Web</h2>
        <p><span class="dropcap">M</span>ara didn't use a phone; she used the dirt. She knelt beneath the Great Oak and pressed her palms to the damp earth. Beneath her, a silent conversation was screaming. A sapling three miles east was starving, and the elders were rerouting sugar through the fungal threads to save it. A beetle infestation was brewing in the north, and the pines were already pumping bitter toxins into their needles in warning.</p>
        <p>"We think we are the only ones who talk," Mara murmured. But the forest was a single, massive brain, woven together by white silken threads. To the trees, a human was just a fast-moving shadow, too busy looking at a glass screen to notice the empire beneath their boots.</p>
        <div class="fact-box">
            <strong>The Helpful Fact:</strong> Mycorrhizal networks (the "Wood Wide Web") are underground fungal networks that allow trees to communicate, share nutrients, and warn each other of predators. In a healthy forest, older "Mother Trees" use this system to keep younger trees alive.
